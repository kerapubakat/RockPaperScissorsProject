TensorFlow Image Data Processor Tasks Final Project Submission


The following is the output of a simple TensorFlow image classification project.
Many issues remain unresolved, including the lack of a training database, the accuracy of 96 percent, loss and val loss that have not been plotted to evaluate whether the data is under, good, or overfitting, and the use of dropouts to counteract overfitting.
But I'm pleased with my first coding project and can't wait to learn more in the future.
